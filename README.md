hitherehash.rb
==============
x = "whats uppppppppp"
you = {x: "im good"}
me = {x => "i love mountains"}

#the first hash is represented by "im good" as a symbol
#the second hash is an undefined local variable. so we would need to
#define what x is and once x is created, it should come up as
# me = {"whats uppppppp => "i love mountains"}
